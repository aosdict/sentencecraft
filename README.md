# sentencecraft
#### Complete each others' sentences. Don't finish what you start.

SentenceCraft is a platform for people to work on writing sentences together, word by word. The twist? When you add on to a sentence, you have no idea who will pick it up next or what they will write.

Paragraph mode is also supported, where each user writes a full sentence instead of a single word.
